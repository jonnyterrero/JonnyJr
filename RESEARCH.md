## Next Steps

- Sketch 3 thumbnails (different compositions: radial, diagonal, grid-breaker)
- Choose 3–4 colors; make a 2x3 swatch grid and test blends
- Block big shapes lightly; reserve highlights; avoid heavy outlines early
- Layer mid-tones, then deepen contrast; add 5–7 high-energy lines for motion
- Add one unexpected accent color (<=5% area) to create a focal pop
