## Key Insights

- RMS: i_rms = sqrt( (1/T) ∫_0^T i^2(t) dt ); Average (rectified): i_avg = (1/T) ∫_0^T |i(t)| dt
- Form factor = i_rms / i_avg; for piecewise signals, compute per interval and sum
- For linear ramps i(t)=k t over 0..T0: ∫ i^2 dt = k^2 T0^3 / 3; ∫ |i| dt = k T0^2 / 2
- For pulse trains: scale b📄 Research report saved to RESEARCH.md

 consistent T for period

## Next Steps

- Identify period T and piecewise expressions for i(t) over one full period
- Compute ∫ i^2(t) dt per interval (use ramp/pulse formulas) and sum → RMS
- Compute ∫ |i(t)| dt per interval and sum → Average (rectified)
- Calculate form factor = RMS / Average; verify with dimensional checks
- Cross-check with numerical approximation in Python/MATLAB
