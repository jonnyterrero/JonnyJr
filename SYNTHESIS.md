- Wire environment: set OPENAI_API_KEY and PPLX_API_KEY locally and in repo Secrets.
- Run locally: "npm run research" then "npm run synthesize"; review outputs.
- Trigger CI: run Personal Project Help with a concrete topic; review PR.
- Add guardrails: update prompts to enforce concise Direct Answers and Next Actions.
- Add test: minimal unit test for "scripts/*.ts" happy-path.
