# Direct Answers
- RMS: i_rms = sqrt((1/T) âˆ«_0^T i^2(t) dt). Average (rectified): i_avg = (1/T) âˆ«_0^T |i(t)| dt.
- Form factor = i_rms / i_avg.

per interval, sum contributions, then normalize by T.
- Check units and use one full period T.

# Next Actions
- Identify one full period T and write piecewise i(t) over [0, T].
- Compute âˆ« i^2(t) dt per interval; sum â†’ i_rms = sqrt((1/T) total).
- Compute âˆ« |i(t)| dt per interval; sum â†’ i_avg = (1/T) total.
- Compute form factor = i_rms / i_avg; sanity-check extremes and dimensions.
- Optionally verify numerically with a small script (Python/MATLAB).

# Materials (if relevant)
- Paper, calculator or CAS, or Python/MATLAB.

# Risks & Mitigations
- Wrong period â†’ Sketch waveform and mark T.
- Missing absolute for average â†’ Use |i(t)|.
- Algebra slips â†’ Keep symbols until final; then plug numbers.
