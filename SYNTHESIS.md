t Actions
- [ ] Review course notes and textbook for relevant concepts
- [ ] Identify which Electrostatics applies to this problem
- [ ] Plan solution approach step-by-step
- [ ] Work through calculations, showing all steps
- [ ] Verify solution using MATLAB
- [ ] Check for common errors and unit consistency
- [ ] Format solution according to assignment requirements

# Materials (if relevant)
- MATLAB, Python (numpy, matplotlib), Circuit simulators
- Halliday & Resnick - Fundamentals of Physics
- Calculator or computational software

# Risks & Mitigations
- Common mistake: Unit inconsistencies → Check units at each step
- Common mistake: Missing forces in diagrams → Draw complete free body diagram
- Verification: Use dimensional analysis and limit checks
