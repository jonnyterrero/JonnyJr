# Sample Brief â€” Bluetooth Audio Research (2025-10-24)

**Goal**: Evaluate options to integrate Bluetooth input with a 4-ch amplifier for a weather-resistant setup.

**Key Findings**
- Boards with on-board DSP simplify EQ but add latency.
- Marine-rated amps with integrated BT reduce wiring complexity.

**Open Questions**
- What is the acceptable latency for your use case (<60 ms?)  
- Need RCA vs. speaker-level input?
